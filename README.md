# Adafruit KB2040 platformio keyboard example

I'm trying to get a working keyboard on an Adafruit KB2040 via platformio.

Currently trying to use [arduino-pico from Earle F. Philhower, III](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico).

[Platformio documentation for that](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html).
